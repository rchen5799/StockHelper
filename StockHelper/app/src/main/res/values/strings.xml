    <string name="over20p1">Have you held this stock for 3 weeks or less? If so, keep holding for at least 5 more weeks!
        Chances are, you have just found a great growth stock. This technique is known as the "8-Week-Hold-Rule."
        Because of how fast the stock is growing, it could have huge chances of becoming a winner! </string>
    <string name="over20p2">If not, you should maybe think about selling! Though it may still have the potential
        to grow, more likely than not, investors will take their profits and cash-out. Over a 20% profit margin
        is already quite significant; waiting any longer may lead the stock to fall... </string>
    <string name="over50">Congrats on the earnings! If you have held this stock for significantly longer than 8 weeks,
        perhaps think about cashing out. Though ultimately use your best judgement. :) </string>
    <string name="Fiveperc"> You are almost matching the SP500! Good job overall, especially if you are new! Keep it up! :) </string>
    <string name="GreaterThan15"> Wow, you. are. a. natural. Keep it up! </string>
    <string name="LessThan15">Hmm... Perhaps thinking about putting some money in the S&amp;P 500 ETF. It is realitively safer than just
        stocks and may yield a greater outcome in the future. However, don\'t let this discourage you!</string>
